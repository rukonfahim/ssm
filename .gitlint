# This is an example of how to configure the "title-max-length" rule and
# set the line-length it enforces to 80
[title-max-length]
line-length=80

# Conversely, you can also enforce minimal length of a title with the
# "title-min-length" rule:
[title-min-length]
min-length=5

[title-must-not-contain-word]
# Comma-separated list of words that should not occur in the title. Matching is case
# insensitive. It's fine if the keyword occurs as part of a larger word (so "WIPING"
# will not cause a violation, but "WIP: my title" will.
words=wip

[title-match-regex]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) that the
# commit-msg title must be matched to.
# Note that the regex can contradict with other rules if not used correctly
# (e.g. title-must-not-contain-word).
regex=MFSS-[0-9]*

[author-valid-email]
# python like regex (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) that the
# commit author email address should be matched to
# E.g.: For example, use the following regex if you only want to allow email
# addresses from foo.com
regex=[^@]+@bkash.com

# This is a contrib rule - a community contributed rule. These are disabled by default.
# You need to explicitly enable them one-by-one by adding them to the "contrib" option
# under [general] section above.
[contrib-title-conventional-commits]
# Specify allowed commit types. For details see: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/
